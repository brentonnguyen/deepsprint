        <h1>About</h1>

        <h2> The Origin of DeepSprint </h2>
        <p> DeepSprint is a website that combines the concepts of the two books,
            "Deep Work" by Cal Newport and "The 12 Week Year" by Brian P. Moran
            and Michael Lennington.
        </p>

        <p> Deep Work teaches us that focused, uninterrupted work on important tasks
            yields better results than multitasking on shallow activities.
            When we eliminate distractions and concentrate on meaningful work, 
            we make significant progress toward our goals.
        </p>

        <p> The 12 Week Year introduces a new approach to goal-setting.
            Instead of spreading our goals across a full year, we break them down
            into 12-week sprints. This shorter timeframe creates urgency and accountability,
            helping us achieve more in less time.
        </p>

        <p>That being said, the lessons in these 2 books are being applied to this website.
            Every feature in this website is intentionally placed to help you achieve your goals.
            This website has the bare minimum and is done so to keep everything minimal.
            Remember, the whole point is provide the essentials and is not to be a distraction.
            We provide, you execute.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <section class="container">
            <p> Hey! My name is Brenton Nguyen. I am a junior in community college studying
            computer science. I am currently working on this website as a side project.
            This website is a culmination of my experiences of using calendar and to-do apps
            over the years and I noticed that these apps do not have features that I wanted.
            </p>

            <p> I am also diagonised with ADHD and the apps that I have used in the past have
                been somewhat helpful, but not 100% to my liking.
            </p>

            <p> With my interests in reading self development and productivity books,
                coming across "Deep Work" and "The 12 Week Year" was a game changer for me.
            </p>

            <p> I came to a realization that there are little to no websites that adopted these
                principles and I wanted to create a website that does just that. I wanted to create
                a website that is aesthetically pleasing, minimalistic, while also only contains the
                essentials and nothing more to keep you focused on the goals you have set.
            </p>

            <p> I hope you enjoy using this website as much as I enjoyed creating
                it! - Brenton Nguyen
